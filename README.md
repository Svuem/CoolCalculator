Unfortunately, since coffee is usually close to a phase transition and loses much of its heat via evaporative cooling, this calculator doesn't really serve its original purpose. For the future, it would be great if I could implement evaporation, convection, radiation and phase transitions all at once. This would involve solving a much more interesting differential equation numerically, which sounds fun! Also I'd implement a environment pressure input, which would be another parameter to play around with. I could then also make a function that calculates the evaporated mass, and maybe give an estimation for the final state of aggregation. But for now, I'll leave it as is.

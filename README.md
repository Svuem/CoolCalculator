Unfortunately, since coffee is usually close to a phase transition and loses much of it's heat via evaporative cooling, this calculator doesn't really serve its original purpose. For the future, it would be great if I could implement evaporation, convection, radiation and phase transitions all at once. This would involve solving a much more interesting differential equation numerically, which sounds great. But for now, I'll leave it as is.
